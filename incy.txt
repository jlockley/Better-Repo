Incy Wincy spider climbing up the spout of the chocolate teapot
Down came the rain and washed the spider's shampoo out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the raindancing australians
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the spout against the cheese
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the rain
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the spout again
