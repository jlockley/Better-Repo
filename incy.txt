Incy Wincy spider climbing up the chimney
Up went the smoke and blew the spider out
In came the wind and flushed away all the smoke
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the chimney again
=======
Incy Wincy spider climbing up the spout of the chocolate teapot
Down came the rain and washed the spider's shampoo out
Out came the sunshine and dried up all the raindancing australians
And Incy Wincy spider climbed up the spout against the cheese
